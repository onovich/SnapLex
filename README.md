# SnapLex

SnapLex is a desktop floating utility for instant screen text capture and translation.
The MVP is planned as a Python + PySide6 application with two primary workflows:

- Screen translation: capture a selected region, run OCR, translate the extracted text, then show the result in a popup.
- Text translation: use a hotkey and clipboard pipeline to translate selected text quickly.

The current project source of truth lives in:

- `docs/SnapLex_Product_Design.pdf`
- `docs/SnapLex_Technical_Architecture.pdf`
- `docs/development_plan.md`
- `docs/phase_plan.md`
- `docs/p0_p7_goal_mode_execution_guide.md`
- `docs/p0_repository_baseline_goal_guide.md`

## Planned Stack

- Python + PySide6 for the desktop shell and floating UI.
- `mss` or `pyautogui` for screen capture.
- PaddleOCR first, with a Tesseract-compatible service boundary.
- Pluggable translation providers for LibreTranslate, OpenAI, DeepL, or local fallback providers.
- PyInstaller for Windows packaging.
